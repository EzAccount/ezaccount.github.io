# About 
Mathematician by day, physicist by night. 

Since fall 2019 I am working with [Leonid Petrov](https://lpetrov.cc/) in integrable probability project. Starting from fall 2020 I'm enrolled in [UVA PhD programm in Mathematics](https://math.virginia.edu/graduate/). 

At the moment I am 4th year undergraduate student at [Faculty of Physics](https://phys.msu.ru), Lomonosov Moscow State University, working with prof. G.V. Koval on spin systems. 

Sometimes I am a part of group led by [Maxim Timokhin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/myutimokhin/) focused on rarefied gas dynamics (in particular: LB method, UGKS).
