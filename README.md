# About 
Mathematician by day, physist by night. 

Since fall 2019 I am working with [Leonid Petrov](https://lpetrov.cc/) in integrable probability project. Starting from fall 2020 I'm enrolled in UVA PhD programm in Mathematics. 

At the moment I am 4th year undergraduate student at Faculty of Physics, Lomonosov Moscow State University, working with prof. G.V. Koval on spin systems. 

Sometimes I am a part of group led by Maxim Timokhin focused on rarefied gas dynamics (in particular: LB method, UGKS).
