![](photo2020.jpg?raw=true)

I am 4th year undergraduate student(currently on leave of absence) at Faculty of Physics, Lomonosov Moscow State University, working with prof. G.V. Koval on spin systems. 

Since fall 2019 I am also working with [Leonid Petrov](https://lpetrov.cc/) in integrable probability project.
In addition I am doing some research with Maxim Timokhin on rarefied gas dynamics (LBM methods), since summer 2017.
