I am a PhD candidate at UVA Math, advised by [L. Petrov](https://lpetrov.cc/). I expect to graduate in Spring 2026, and <b>I am on the job market for Fall 2026</b>. For more details about my experience, please see my CV [here](TikhonovCV.pdf).

<b> Research Interests </b> I work on problems in integrable probability and statistical mechanics, studying stochastic systems such as random permutations, lozenge tilings, stochastic vertex models, polymer models, and random walks. A central feature of these systems is <i>integrability</i>, which arises from their underlying geometric or algebraic structures. Recently, my research has centered on applications of vertex models (and related tools, such as the Yang-Baxter Equation) to other areas of mathematics and to other sciences.

During my undergraduate studies in physics, I also worked with systems in statistical mechanics. My work with M. Timokhin was focused on Lattice Boltzmann Method and rarefied gas dynamics, and my undergaduate thesis (advised by G. Koval) was about classical Ising model with quenched disorder and quantum spin chains.
