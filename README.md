I am a PhD student/candidate at UVA Math, currently working under the supervision of [L. Petrov](https://lpetrov.cc/). 

My previous research experience include working with M. Timokhin on rarefied gas dynamics and applications, and with Prof. Koval on classical and quantum spin chain systems. 

For more details, you can refer to my CV which is accessible [here](MikhailTikhonovCV.pdf).
