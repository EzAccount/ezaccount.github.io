# About 
Mathematician by day, physicist by night. 

Since fall 2019 I am working with [Leonid Petrov](https://lpetrov.cc/) in integrable probability project. 

Sometimes I am a part of group led by [Maxim Timokhin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/myutimokhin/) focused on rarefied gas dynamics (in particular: LB method, UGKS).
