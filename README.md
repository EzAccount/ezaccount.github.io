# About 
![](photo2020.jpg?raw=true)

I am 4th year undergraduate student at Faculty of Physics, Lomonosov Moscow State University, working with prof. G.V. Koval on spin systems. 
I am a part of group led by Maxim Timokhin focused on rarefied gas dynamics (in particular: LB method, UGKS).

Since fall 2019 I am also working with [Leonid Petrov](https://lpetrov.cc/) in integrable probability project.
